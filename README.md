# iOS-widgets
The Repo contains various iOS widgets I programmed using the Scriptable app.\
The widgets were made for iPhone XR so I hard coded some dimensions, so it might not work for other iOS devices.\
\
Here is how the widgets look on my screen:\
in order,\
Year Progress Widget\
Clash Royale Favorite Card Widget\
Spotify Widget (I made the widget when I was using iOS14 beta, Spotify did not have their official widget then, now they do, so I suggest using the official widget, as it has more features)\
